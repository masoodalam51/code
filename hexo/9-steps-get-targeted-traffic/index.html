<p>What is your main goal at writing blogs? Even if you are a guest blogger? Getting quality and targeted traffic to your blog post. If you write great post but no one comes to your blog to read your post what you do in this situations? Quitting a blogging or apply some technique to get your traffic. In this article I am showing you a 9 steps to get targeted traffic to your blog. Keep in mind applying this technique not instantly increase website traffic, its time consuming process. Many blogger already done some steps which is listed below but if you not apply this steps in your blog than its time to take some action and give new life to your blog. <a id="more"></a></p>
<p>As I said earlier this is time consuming process, its takes one month to six month but its definitely help. According to some case study you get results in 24 to 48 hours, but in my opinion building targeted traffic is taking time. One thing keep in mind writing a quality and genuine articles helps you to win half battle for winning other half battle you must do step 2 to step 9. Don’t d-motivated yourself if you can’t get traffic, improve yourself and keep blogging. </p>
<div class="note">Step 1. Write Original Content:</div>

<p>In my opinion this is a heart of any blog, when you browse an Internet than you saw many website which is not done any seo related things are getting higher rank. Why?  Because they write original content. Original and unique content are getting higher priority in both search engines spiders and human eyes. When you read any successful blog they always recommend to creating an original content. Let’s took one example, think about your assignment which is written by you and if someone copy your assignment but your teacher knows who wrote this assignment then tell me who get full marks or higher marks.</p>
<p>Search engines are really brilliant, they continuously scan whole Internet for original content and if your content copy by some other blogger or website they penalized that blogger or website.</p>
<p>I know producing original content every time is really difficult task but this worth it. What if you didn’t get any original idea, then check other blogger post which is in your niche read their latest post and find what left by them or how you improve that topic then write your content but one thing keep in mind never copy from their post. If you describe their topic with extra knowledge and give your own opinion on that topic this is also count in original post.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Never forget to link back to other blogger if you get ideas from their post.</p>
<div class="note">Step 2. Write Constantly:</div>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GvPk9lsehtc/VHdplMSL5UI/AAAAAAAACls/KDuvxRJ6OCo/s1600/write-constantly.jpg" alt="Write Constantly"></p>
<p>My biggest mistake in blogging life is not write content consistently. If you read my blog you find only 30 articles (at the time of writing) from November 2012. This number told itself I am not writing consistently. Obviously I have many excuses but in blogging world this excuses not working. My blog rank down continuously and I lost my feed subscribers. This is a huge loss in terms of money and time. </p>
<p>Think you got a wonderful job bit you can’t work consistently then what happened? Boss gives you a warning and after warning if your work is not acceptable then you are fired from your job. Blogging is also give you a warning about your losing ranks or subscribers but what good about blogging, you always have a second chance and if your content is published constantly then you never misses your beloved readers.</p>
<p>From above paragraph you have a clear idea about how constant writing is helpful to get new readers and engaging your existing readers but if you write only for writing constantly then it’s your biggest mistake and it’s ruin your blogging readership. Why? This question is roaming in your mind. Answer of this question is given in first point where I say you to write original content. If you writing your post for post count then originality of articles hurt and you simply copycat another blog post or write content which is not helpful for your readers.</p>
<div class="note">Step 3. Post Contains 2000 to 2500 Words:</div>

<p>Word count of any post tells about author research and knowledge about topic of post. More word count means you have a more knowledge about your topic which is discussed in your blog and its attracted readers to comment on your post. If your post word count less than 600 words than readers thinks you don’t have knowledge about your topic and its affect relationship between you and your readers. Main mistake of new blogger is they want to show no of post to readers and for this purpose their post content only 300-500 words, but if you want to generate a traffic and also want your post is shared frequently by your readers than my advice is create post with minimum 1500 words. If you can’t produce a post more 500 word then blogging is not for you. Many blogger hire some writers for this purpose but no one create your own master piece. Guest posting is very good option if you unable to create a long post which is more than 2000 word count. </p>
<p>For example you read some <a href="http://shoutmeloud.com/" title="ShoutMeLoud" target="_blank" rel="external">ShoutMeLoud</a> post and find most popular and most commented post. Post which is containing more words is most commented and most sharable. Post which have more than 1800 to 3000 words is most sharable on social networking website.  Words count also attracts search engine spiders to having clear idea about your blog topic and you niche. This helps you to avoid any seo penalty (e.g. Google Panda).</p>
<p>According to case study done by <a href="http://blog.serpiq.com/how-important-is-content-length-why-data-driven-seo-trumps-guru-opinions/" title="How Important is Content Length?" target="_blank" rel="external">serpiq</a>, blog post which contains more than 2450 words generate more traffic. </p>
<center><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hrCU8I25dTc/VHdMiIHTdZI/AAAAAAAACks/kQ4sd2BS-Hg/s1600/average-content-length-top-results.jpg" alt="Average Content Length of Top 10 Results"></center>

<div class="note">Step 4. Comments on Another Blog:</div>

<p>Commenting on another blog is oldest way for attracting new traffic to your blog. Right and genuine commenting is also help to make your credibility in both readers and author of blog. Comment is a powerful medium but some bloggers abuse it only for back links, for e.g. “what a great post” or “I am first to comment” or “my blog url is<strong>__</strong>“. This helps of comments are not approved and it’s not have any value. For commenting first find  authority blog in your niche and if you find any mistakes or you think any extra points which is left by author then you start your comments. Also if you found any questions in comments which are not answered by author or you think the answers is not justifying the question then add your answer. Many blogger allowed to add your blog address in comments which is helpful for your blog but don’t add any irrelevant link.</p>
<p>Comment is also very important in terms of seo. Think your blog is new and search spiders are not visited your blog frequently but if you comment on popular and authority blog with your link then search spiders follow your link from that blog and index your blog easily. Please check this case study where you get cleared idea about <a href="http://www.shoutmeloud.com/google-page-rank-3-for-a-website-with-no-content-case-study.html" title="Effects of Commenting on Blog Traffic" target="_blank" rel="external">how comments drive traffic for new blog.</a> </p>
<div class="note">Step 5. Make Headline Interesting:</div>

<p>Making article headline interesting grabbed users attention. They curious about your post content and want to find what you explain or teach. Below some examples of interesting title which are always work.</p>
<ol>
<li>How to (something) in (number) ways/steps </li>
<li>(Number) ways to (do something) </li>
</ol>
<p>Above example are simplified in below</p>
<ol>
<li>How to write killer post in 10 easy ways/steps</li>
<li>10 ways to get genuine traffic </li>
</ol>
<p>This headline create buzz in readers mind and they curious about your content, when they saw this type of titles they automatically thinks post provides information or step by step guide. In my opinion if you write post in two or three hour than spend at least five to fifteen minutes for making interesting title. According to my research every pro blogger make catchy and interesting title for attracting readers. But choosing right title is tricky. If you tutorial article than “How to” is better than “5 ways”, so choose wisely because if your article is well research and your title is boring than attracting new user to your article is very difficult task.</p>
<div class="note">Step 6. Share Your Articles on Social Networks:</div>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9gHXSa4ZJpM/VHdxp9N_W5I/AAAAAAAACmE/LakVuOCIJMg/s1600/share-your-articles-on-socia-networks.jpg" alt="Always Share Your Articles"></p>
<p>Suppose you start a shop and you want to sell great product in cheaper rates but your shop is located in outer area where people doesn’t know about you products and rates so in this situation what you do? One easy solution is distributing hand bill or put a banner on many areas. Promotion of your post is also work in a same way which is explained above. Think you write a great content but no one reads it then it’s a huge loss of your time and money because “time is money “. Promotion of post is done in many ways like you share on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/techelex" title="TECHELEX Facebook Page Page" target="_blank" rel="external">Facebook</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/techelex" title="TECHELEX Twitter Fan Page" target="_blank" rel="external">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/+techelex" title="TECHELEX Google+ Fan Page" target="_blank" rel="external">Google+</a> and many other social sharing networks.</p>
<p>For promoting your content first you created a page in Facebook and Google+ it’s helped you to create your brand. Facebook provides you a massive traffic where Google+ provides seo back links for your post. Sharing on twitter with hash tag (#tag) is providing a great exposure to your post. If your post is related to data driven research or technology than sharing on LinkedIn helps you. If your post contains lot of images than share on pinterest. Posting on social website is really helpful but what happens when your user wants to share your post on their social profile. Install a staring bar or add share buttons in your post. Many services present to solve this problem like <a href="http://www.techelex.org/shareaholic-related-post-plugin-hexo/" title="Shareaholic Related Post Plugin For Hexo" target="_blank" rel="external">Shareaholic</a>.</p>
<div class="note">Step 7. Write Articles in Easier Language:</div>

<p>When reader comes to your blog he/she wants your natural tone because it’s help him /her to judge your ability and personality. Many blogger think if they write articles in difficult words or tone than this helps to get wider audience. One fact which is forgotten by blogger is every one in world wants everything in simple and easier manner. This fact is also applies in blogging world. When you write your articles one thing keep in mind your blog post is able to read by fifth standard child, but many times post need terms which is very complex it’s okay because every post have different characteristics and in my observation this post are generally deep research on topic.</p>
<div class="note">Step 8. SEO (Search Engine Optimization):</div>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-l_He3g_T4Ms/VHdzWvbMuKI/AAAAAAAACmQ/qpESqInQuG0/s1600/seo-organic-traffic.jpg" alt="Proper Seo Always Generates Traffic for You"></p>
<p>SEO (search engine optimization) is a main key to drive a huge traffic to your blog. If you are not apply any seo techniques to your blog than in my opinion you live in 2000. In seo terms keywords are important, perfect keywords describe your post accurately and it’s also guess which terms you readers will use for search. Don’t use heavily populated keywords because if it’s a heavily popular than thousands of bloggers already written on it and your articles are lost in crowd. Use keywords in 2-4 ratio means in 100 words you place your keywords in 3 to 6 times but if you keep in 2 or 3 than its a better option.<br>When you optimized your article for seo, keep honesty in mind, because some blogger abuses SEO. For example if you search on Internet for “SEO” terms than you see how SEO expert have made it impossible to get genuine or reliable information about that topic.</p>
<p><strong>1) Article heading:</strong><br>This is the title of your post, this is the best place where you put your main keyword. keep article heading informative and creative. Check this case study where you learn only change article heading get you traffic.</p>
<p><strong>2) Page Url:</strong><br>Post url is the place where your main keyword going because it’s read by search engine. Don’t confuse in article heading and page url. Article heading mainly for user where post url for search engine spiders. Google or any other search engine first analyze your post url after analyzing it they analyze whole article. If you place your main keyword in page url then it’s easily pick up by search engine and they decide what user searching for. Below I give you a one example.</p>
<ul>
<li>“complete-step-by step-guide-to-install-octopress-in-windows 7”</li>
<li>“how-to-setup-octopress-on-windows7” </li>
<li>“how-to-setup-octopress-windows7”. </li>
</ul>
<p>You see in third post url example I am not included “on” which is add in earlier example because it’s not add any seo benefits in my post url and it’s also make my post url is lengthy.</p>
<p>For better post url don’t add “of”, “on”, “in” but you allow to add this word in article heading. If your post url contain 3 or 4 words which is your main keywords of your post then it’s gets higher exposure in search engine in comparison with other post which url contains 9-10 words or containing stop words.</p>
<p><strong>3) Place Your Keywords Inside the Post Content:</strong><br>At the time of writing place your keywords in articles frequently but as I said before keep 3-4 ratios. Always select long tail keywords because their competition is low and you easily get high ranking in search engine. According to Google always put your main keyword in first 100 words.</p>
<p><strong>4) Meta description:</strong><br>Meta description tells search engine about post content. Always keep your meta description in 156 alphabet. This is quick glance for readers who search topic on search engine. For writing meta description give minimum 5 to 10 minute.</p>
<p><strong>5) Alt Tag:</strong><br>Search engines are reading only text and unable to saw images. So what you do in this situation? Adding alt tag in every image is a solution. Keep your alt tag relevant to post and also change your image name.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> change “IMG_20141020_230024.jpg” to some informative name like “seo-steps-blogger-blogspot.jpg”</p>
<div class="note">Step 9. Put Image and Videos in Your Post:</div>

<p><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wb-l1tpTFOo/VHd25D0NMDI/AAAAAAAACmY/vWoaCm9Jxcg/s1600/image-video-post.jpg" alt="Relevant Images and Videos Gets Maximum Exposure"></p>
<p>Images are adding life in your post because images tells thousands words. It’s described your motto and give visual information about your post. According to <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/blog/tabid/6307/bid/33800/Photos-on-Facebook-Generate-53-More-Likes-Than-the-Average-Post-NEW-DATA.aspx" title="Photos Generates Higher Shares" target="_blank" rel="external">this case study</a> blog post which contains image is most sharable on social networking sites as compared to a post which contains only text information. Add image in your post in high quality. Images resolution in between HD (1280x720) or full HD (1980x1080) is acceptable because now days everyone have a smart phone with high speed networks. Many websites provides a quality images or stock photos for free. Below link give you high resolution image free of cost without any license means you use it for your personal and professional use. </p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>  <a href="https://unsplash.com/" title="Unsplash | Free High-Resolution Photos" target="_blank" rel="external">Unsplash | Free High-Resolution Photos</a></p>
<p>If you want to teach any tutorial to your readers than video is a best medium to share your knowledge. In my opinion if images tell thousands words than videos tells a million words. Never produce your video below 720p (1280x720) for the same reason which is stated above paragraph. For hosting video use YouTube, it’s helped you in seo and also saves huge money from your monthly hosting bill.</p>
<p>Tell us from above technique <strong>which technique you used in your blog post to get traffic?</strong> if you have any idea, dont shy. Comment below with your ideas and suggestion. Good luck and have a good day.</p>
