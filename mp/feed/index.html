<p>Railway safety is a crucial aspect of rail operation over the world. Railways being the cheapest mode of transportation are preferred over all the other means. When we read newspaper, we come across many railway accidents occurring at unmanned railway crossings. This is mainly due to the carelessness in manual operations or lack of workers. And also the collision of two trains due to the same track. This automatic railway crossing gate model deals with two things. Firstly, it deals with the reduction of time for which the gate is being kept closed. And secondly, to provide safety to the road users by reducing the accidents that usually occur due to carelessness of road users and at times errors made by the gatekeepers.<br />
Aim of this project is control the unmanned rail gate automatically using embedded platform. Today often we see news papers very often about the railway accidents happening at un- attended railway gates. Present project is designed to avoid such accidents if implemented in spirit.</p>

<p>This kind of Navigation for Impaired Person project basically suffices for the one who suffers from physical disabilities. This is another kind of hospitality project, which enables the impaired person to navigate without their handicap being their hurdle. Suitable for amputees of arms and legs, it is one of a kind project that helps impaired persons to navigate from one place to another.<br />
It is one of the most exciting projects that will determine the blurring of line between handicapped and normal persons. Technology has indeed made our lives better for physically impaired personalities and their differently-abled qualities can make world a better to place to live with the combination of this technology.</p>

During winter season, there is a problem of haze and fog that reduces visibility to almost zero. In such cases, accidents are most likely to happen as the visibility is not that clear. Also there are some applications that are depended on quantity of fog in the atmosphere. There are many times when fog is major hindrance to work.<br />
There are many times when there is a fire management issue. Many of the fire detecting devices operate on smoke detection. The fire is detected by the smoke indicator. The smoke detection system is very mandatory to prevent fire as it is the best possible be applied le option to detect fire.<br />
The fog and smoke detection system is implemented as a precautionary project as a safety consideration. It is one of the safest possible available Smoke and Fog Detector to detect smoke and fire. </p>

<p>Power Devices such as Geyser, Heater etc. had been common from long time now. We had geysers and heaters the heat the water during cold weather. Now such heating devices have become fully automated with the advent of technology. Gone are the days when we used to ON the geyser and wait the time till water gets heated and then carefully torn off the geyser and during leaking walls, on which geysers are placed on, worry as the entire wall gets current due to geyser short circuiting. Now all these geyser related worries are a thing of past now, as we have SMART GEYSER systems available.<br />
Now you can switch on your geyser by just a click of remote/Mobile/RF. For example, you just need to press the remote/Mobile/RF and turn on and off your geyser the same way you turn off your television. You can configure a set time for SMART geyser that it automatically turns on itself once it receives signal in form of IR/Mobile/RF. It can be turned off in similar manner.<br />
No need to get up and involve in button pressing at geyser panel. Geysers can be placed anywhere in the bathroom and you just need to press the remote/Mobile/RF to turn it ON and OFF.<br />
Geysers have really become automatic by use of Infrared Systems that eases much of our inconveniences.<br />
Haven’t technology made our lives much smart? Smart Geyser is one such example.</p>
<p><strong>Its Have Three Types,</strong><br />

Curtains are the guardians of windows. Nowadays, we find lots of curtains that are not only made of cloth but various other materials as well. Mostly in office chambers, we have curtains that slide with the use of remote. This is the same kind of stuff of controlling the curtains to open and close using remote control.<br />
You are sitting in comfort of your sofa and you need some fresh air from your window. There is no need to get up from your place to move the curtains to bring in some fresh air inside. Just press the button of your remote and there you see the curtains move on automatically. There is a lot of scope of this project in future as now almost everything in domestic appliance is getting automated and curtains are not left behind as well.<br />
The Curtain Raiser or Remote Operated Curtain is one of the parts of Novel Home Automation System. Such systems give your home a hi-tech gaze and this system is starting  to find reception in many of the contemporary homes.</p>

Many of have heard the kind of watch that is worn on hands and the wrist watch that it gets can’t get any better than this. An electronic student’s innovative project that resemble themselves a lot like Apple’s I-watch that is going to be launched very soon in international market.<br />
The most beautiful and aesthetic project shows you the time along with various displays that are embedded in the watch. The Electronic Watch (or simply the E-watch) is the toast of the project for MS-CIT /ITI projects. One of the most attractive projects that illustrate you the time in a watch that you have made by your own and you can customize the watch whenever and wherever possible with extravagant features like flashing light, buzzer, alarm and much more. Isn’t the E-watch interesting project?</p>

<p>You might have seen in many competitions that generate automatic random winners by drawing of lots or by throwing of dice or tossing a coin. All these are based on pure chance. This is used to determine the lottery type of thing. We often see randomness as major part in the matter of chance. It just pure luck and there is nothing based away from it.<br />
Many corporations use this chance system like coin tossing, dice throwing to determine slots which cannot be determined otherwise and has the best option of drawing of lots. Even FIFA uses drawing of lots, a pure luck based system, while deciding draws for its World Cup.<br />
Sometimes, throw of chance is the only way out in methodological situations. An electronic chance dice is the type of dice that operates in such a principle. It is similar to throwing of dice in front of gatherings of large crowd. The electronic chance dice randomly picks a number amongst 1 to 6 and flashes in front of giant screen and then the processes are complete.<br />
It’s fun, entertainment, randomness, technology and pure luck all fused together. </p>

<p>The one thing that we in today’s times cannot avoid is mobile phones. Youngsters today can live without food, but they want their smart-phones with them round the clock. But the major hindrance to them is that their smart-phone needs to be charged now and then. <span id="more-193"></span>There are different types of portable options available to charge your mobile phone during your travel time. The traveling mobile charger comes as a handy way of charging your mobile phones while you are on the go. Now you don’t need to worry about mobile battery life. As you have all the new options to charge your mobile phone anywhere anytime. All you just need is our Smart Green Charger that comes to your aid when you are travelling and you don’t have electrical sockets around.<br />
Just works on the batteries fine and sound. Replace the battery and charge your mobile whether you are miles away from your hometown and you don’t have your charger as well. Just carry the Smart Green Charger For Journey with you and forget all the worries of your battery use. By this, the battery duration becomes irrelevant as you can charge the mobile anywhere anytime on the go. It’s today’s prospective project and one that has the potential to create lots of splash with it.</p>

<p>A Street light gets on during nights and gets switched off at mornings. But still they are manually operated. By use of the said technology, the sensors mounted on the street lights detect the intensity of light and switch ON/OFF the street light automatically. For example, its 6PM but still its bright light in one place, while at other place at 5PM it starts going dark. Suppose if the automatic timer is set at 6PM at both the places, both the place gets misused of lights. The place where light is still bright gets unnecessary wastage of electricity by switching ON at 6PM, whereas the place where it’s actually needed at 5PM, they had to wait till 6PM. So all get messed up!<br />
Thus, instead of timer based automatic system, this uses light intensity based on surroundings. Thus, if it detects that light is fading, it switches the lights ON only when natural light falls below certain intensity. The intensity of the street light can be also controlled automatically using Automatic intensity control of street light based on the input of natural light. A micro-controller based project, very effective in saving lots of electricity and actually helping the street light management a great deal.</p>

But here in our system we are using electronic switches, touch panels and wireless remote control unit. The role of this system is same as that of the old-style switch board, but in a smarter way.
